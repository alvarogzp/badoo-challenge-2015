# [Badoo Coding Challenge](http://challenge.badoo.com/) (2015)

These are my solutions to the Badoo Coding Challenge (2015 edition).

For each problem, there is:
- A `Description.txt` file with problem description.
- A `solution` file with the code that solves the problem, with the extension according to the language used (`.py` for python, `.java` for java, etc.).
- The problem input and output for the test and final phases.
- In some problems, there are additional files.


**Languages used**
- Python (problems [01](01-Pass_the_message), [02](02-Car_Park), [05](05-The_poor_chimpanzees), [06](06-Cheating_classes), [07](07-Seek_and_Destroy), [08](08-Weeping_weavers), [09](09-Hot_or_Not))
- Bash (problem [03](03-Pattern_matcher))
- Java (problem [10](10-Badoolization))


### Problem notes

Problem 04 was disabled, so it is not included here (it was disabled before I reached it, so I don't have its description neither).

Problem 10 contain the solution inside the `src` directory.
