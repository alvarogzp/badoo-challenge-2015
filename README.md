# [Badoo Coding Challenge](http://challenge.badoo.com/) (2015)

These are my solutions to the Badoo Coding Challenge (2015 edition).

For each problem, there is:
- A `Description.txt` file with problem description.
- A `solution` file with the code that solves the problem, with the extension according to the language used (`.py` for python, `.java` for java, etc.).
- The problem input and output for the test and final phases.
- In some problems, there are additional files.


**Languages used**
- Python (problems 01, 02, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09)
- Bash (problem 03)
- Java (problem 10)


### Problem notes

Problem 04 was disabled, so it is not included here (it was disabled before I reached it, so I don't have its description neither).

Problem 10 contain the solution inside the `src` directory.
