The Euclidean algorithm

The Euclidean algorithm, or Euclid’s algorithm, is an efficient method for computing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, the largest number that divides both of them without leaving a remainder. It is named after the ancient Greek mathematician Euclid, who first described it in Euclid’s Elements (c. 300 BC). It is an example of an algorithm, a step-by-step procedure for performing a calculation according to well-defined rules, and is one of the oldest numerical algorithms in common use. It can be used to reduce fractions to their simplest form, and is a part of many other number-theoretic and cryptographic calculations. [source: Wikipedia]

Can you write a program that implements it?

Input

First line will contain the number of test cases T. T blocks will follow with: One line containing three integers: A that indicates the first integer. B that indicates the second integer. G that indicates a tentative greatest common divisor (GCD) of A and B.

Output

The program should output one line per test case with OK if the provided GCD is right or the real GCD if it’s different.

Limits

T <= 10

A, B, G <= 100

A, B, G > 0
