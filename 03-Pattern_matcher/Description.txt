Pattern matcher

Your friend has started to write his own database. He’s asked you to help with writing a function to match strings. He wants something better than a simple “like” in SQL but faster than regexp.

His pattern matcher should be very strict. It should match all strings or none. For example if the pattern is Hello, it will match only Hello, but not Hello_ and not _Hello.
His pattern should use ! followed by text and ended with another ! to say that the string does not contain text between exclamation sign in the place you specify.

For example:
a!bb!c should match ac, adc, ammmmmc, but not “abbc” and not “bbbc” and not “bc”.
Any text inside !! is taken as a character. For example !*! means any character except star. !?! means any character except question mark. !^! means any character except circumflex (^).

^ should match any uppercase symbol.
a^ should match aA, aB, aC, but not aa, bA.

* should match any or no symbols.
H*llo should match Hello, Hllo.

? should match any one symbol.
H?llo should match Hello, Hillo, but not Hllo.

Input
Each first line contains the pattern, each second line contains the string to match. There can be several pairs of lines until it reaches the end of the file.

Output
The program should output y if the pattern matched the string or n if not, followed by a new line symbol.

Example

Input:
hello
hello world
*
hello world
!Info!*
Info: Solve this puzzle, don’t upset your friend
!Info!*
Debug Info: Solve this puzzle, don’t upset your friend 

Output:
n
y
n
